# M5M Foundation
Changing Lives Through Nutrition

## OUR MISSION
Our mission is to combat the effects of global malnutrition by providing food sourced supplements to children in need.

## OUR VISION
Our vision is to see over five million children across the world embrace a greater quality of life, thriving, nourished and full of hope.

## ABOUT US
The M5M Foundation is an independent 501c (3) non-profit charity organization. It was officially launched on January 1, 2015. Executive Director Sarah Louthan oversees the daily operations as well as coordinates the expansion of the organization’s efforts. Sarah has traveled extensively throughout her career, attending international mission outreaches and experiencing firsthand the effects of childhood malnutrition. In 2014, she had the privilege of visiting Guatemala with one of our partners, RU 4 Children, which solidified her passion to help others. Her dream has been realized with the M5M Foundation.

## WHAT WE DO
The M5M Foundation serves to bring hope. Mannatech, Inc., a direct sales company, engaged in research, development and distribution of health and wellness products, had a passion to apply their real-food technology and glyconutrient supplements to help tackle a global issue. They had the resources that would help malnourished children receive proper nutrition, but they needed a way to supply it. The M5M Foundation acts as an ambassador for these children by delivering the gift of better nutrition which Mannatech provides through their PhytoBlend™ product.
